# 💪 Pull up

Collect scattered config files from your monorepo and generate them where your systems expect.

## The Problem

Many tools require config files in specific locations:

- GitHub reads `CODEOWNERS` from `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- GitHub Actions workflows must live in `.github/workflows/`
- And more...

In a monorepo, each package has its own context. But these systems only look at root-level paths. You end up with a single massive file that every team has to edit, leading to merge conflicts and unclear ownership.

## The Solution

**Pull up** lets you keep config files next to the code they describe, then collects and generates them to the locations your systems expect.

```
packages/
  core/
    CODEOWNERS        # * @core-team
  web/
    CODEOWNERS        # * @frontend-team
  api/
    CODEOWNERS        # * @backend-team

↓ pullup sync

.github/
  CODEOWNERS          # All entries merged with correct paths
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D pull-up
# or
yarn add -D pull-up
# or
pnpm add -D pull-up
```

## Usage

### Sync

Generate files from scattered sources:

```bash
pullup sync
```

Preview changes without writing:

```bash
pullup sync --dry-run
```

### Check

Verify generated files are up to date (useful in CI):

```bash
pullup check
```

## Example: CODEOWNERS

Place `CODEOWNERS` files in each package:

```
# packages/core/CODEOWNERS
* @core-team
```

```
# packages/web/CODEOWNERS
* @frontend-team
*.css @design-team
```

Run `pullup sync --rule codeowners` to generate `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```
# @generated by pullup - do not edit manually

/packages/core/ @core-team
/packages/web/ @frontend-team
/packages/web/*.css @design-team

# @end-generated
```

Existing manual entries in the file are preserved outside the generated markers.
